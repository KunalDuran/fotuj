Photo shortlisting application


Pain point:
 - Hectic photo selection process for wedding album.
 - Data sharing [hard disk or cloud storage]
 - Back and forth travel or chats between photographer and client 


MVP:
    Client-side [selector]
    - show all/selected images.
    - slideshow with togglable select button.
    - selection completed button -> notify the photographer


    Photographer side [parser]
    - Run our tool to upload images to the cloud.
    - generate shareable link.

    - parser will upload photos to the s3 bucket
    - on the server side (optimize/compress image?)
    - after completion -> protected link

    - client can see all the photos
    - start selecting -> http request photo's uid.

    - storing in Database.


Technologies:
    - Language: Go and HTML/CSS/Bootstrap (maybe react in future?).
    - Database: SQLite3 (mongodb ?)
    - Hosting: AWS EC2 instance
    - Cloud storage: AWS S3 bucket.
    - Version control : Github
    - CICD: github actions?
